THREADGROUP:
------------
Based on the functionality, we can group threads into a single unit. (i.e) A thread group contains a group of threads.
In addition to threads, a ThreadGroup can also contain sub ThreadGroups.

ADVANTAGE :- We can perform common operations very easily.

Every Thread in java belongs to some ThreadGroup. Main thread belongs to main group. Every ThreadGroup in java is the child group of SystemGroup either directly or indirectly.
Hence SystemGroup acts as root for all the ThreadGroup in java. SystemGroup contains several system level threads like Finalizer, ReferenceHandler, SignalDispatcher, AttachListner.

ThreadGroup is a java class present in java.lang and its the direct child class of Object.
